1. MERN stack quiz app. 

   . Quiz questions are fetched from API and stored into MongoDB. 
   
   . On the front end, I use React because it allows developers to reuse components. Additionally, its Virtual Dom ensures components can be reendered quickly.
   
   . After the user selects the answer, the answer is checked and scored. If the answer is correct, the user gets a point. Otherwise, he won't get anything. After that, the user's choices and scores are stored in MongoDB.
   
   . The user presses the "previous" and "next" buttons, and the record is extracted from MongoDB and displayed on the web page, where the user can view their own answers.
   
   . After the user submits the quiz, they can see the correct answers, their choices, and the total score.

2. Please "git clone" the project and run "npm install".

3. The password for connecting to MongoDB in .env is hidden.
